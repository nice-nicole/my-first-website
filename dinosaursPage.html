            <p>Most people think of <strong>dinosaurs</strong> as <em>big</em>, 
                <em>ferocious</em> and <em>extinct</em> reptiles.
                That's largely true, but there are some misconceptions. 
                Dinosaurs came in all shapes and sizes.
                Dinosaurs were the largest land animals of all time, 
                but a great number of dinosaurs were smaller than a turkey

            <h2>Descriptions of some types of dinosaurs</h2>
            <p><strong>Flying on:</strong>
            Only the <em> big, classic </em>dinosaurs are extinct.
            Birds are living dinosaurs, most experts believe.
            Think of that next time a pigeon strafes you.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Ornithischia:</strong>
            A group that are more mild-mannered, plant eaters.
            They are beaked herbivores,smaller.
            They shifted from two-legged to a four-legged posture
            at least three times in their evolutionary history.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Marine reptiles:</strong>
            A lot of dinosaurs was happening below surface of
            the world's oceans. THis abundant family of Marine
            reptiles largely went at the end of jurassic Period.
