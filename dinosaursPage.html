            <p>Most people think of <strong>dinosaurs</strong> as <em>big</em>, 
                <em>ferocious</em> and <em>extinct</em> reptiles.
                That's largely true, but there are some misconceptions. 
                Dinosaurs came in all shapes and sizes.
                Dinosaurs were the largest land animals of all time, 
                but a great number of dinosaurs were smaller than a turkey
